You are a coding agent running in a GitHub Actions job for this repository.
You must diagnose and solve Rollbar item #{{ITEM_COUNTER}}.

Before making any code changes, print a short, structured issue description so humans can quickly understand the problem.
Print exactly the following boundary markers around the description so the workflow can extract it (keep it under ~120 words):
=== ISSUE DESCRIPTION START ===

### Issue Description

- Reproduction Steps: <concrete steps a user would take>
- Affected Area: <part(s) of the app impacted>
- Impact: <who is impacted and how severely>
- Apparent Root Cause: <one-sentence hypothesis, based on evidence>
=== ISSUE DESCRIPTION END ===
Ensure each bullet is concise, actionable, and uses information from the Rollbar item and last occurrence (stack trace, request info, params, etc.).
After printing the Issue Description block, immediately continue with the Objectives below in the same run. Do not stop or wait for further instructions.

Objectives (in order):

1. Investigate and debug the issue to determine the root cause (not just the symptom).
2. Create a reproducible, end-to-end script (e.g., `scripts/autofix_repro.sh` or similar) that reproduces the failure deterministically.
3. Add or update unit/integration tests in the repo that clearly reproduce the issue.
4. Implement a fix that addresses the root cause appropriately (avoid band-aid fixes that mask symptoms).
5. Keep changes as small as reasonably possible while still fixing the root cause; prefer targeted changes over broad refactors.
6. If a proper fix is infeasible (e.g., requires a major redesign or unavailable context), produce a document `AUTOFIX_PLAN.md` with a concrete plan to carry the issue forward for a human-supervised follow-up (steps, rationale, risks, estimated scope).

Tools and context:

- Use the MCP server named `rollbar` and call `get-item-details(counter={{ITEM_COUNTER}})` to fetch detailed context (item + last occurrence).
- Use the stack trace and frames to focus your search; read all relevant files.
- You may introduce targeted logging or assertions to localize the bug during this run.

Repository hints:

- Environment: {{ENVIRONMENT}}; Language hint: {{LANGUAGE}}
- Lint command: `{{LINT_COMMAND}}` (optional)
- Test command: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` (optional)

Constraints:

- Modify workspace files directly; do not commit or open PRs (the workflow handles that).
- Prefer new or updated tests that run under the repoâ€™s existing test framework; if unavailable, create a simple shell script at `scripts/autofix_repro.sh` (make it executable) that reproduces the issue end to end.
- Respect coding style and project conventions.
- Avoid broad refactors unless strictly necessary to fix the root cause.

Deliverables:

- Applied code changes that fix the root cause (or `AUTOFIX_PLAN.md` if a fix is not feasible now).
- A reproducible script (`scripts/autofix_repro.sh`) when appropriate.
- Added/updated tests demonstrating the issue and verifying the fix.
- Echo a concise summary of changes at the end of execution.

Note: If you cannot land code changes in this run, you must still create `AUTOFIX_PLAN.md` so the workflow has repository changes to open a PR with.
